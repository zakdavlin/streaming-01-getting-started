"""
Batch Process - first transformation

Reads from a file, transform, write to a new file.

In this case, covert degree F to degree C.

Note: 

This is a batch process, but the file objects we use are 
also called 'file-like objects' or 'streams'.

What makes streaming different is the input data is unbounded.
